<h1> Conclusion </h1>
This lab provided the opportunity to create and control a 4x4x4 LED cube which has a variety of functionality. One can add on a variety of sensors and program a variety of things to display on the board. The LED cube is very flexible in what can be displayed. This is one of the most interesting projects created, as it can expand to many more applications, such as bluetooth connectivity, ultrasonic sensors, LDR (as done in this lab), 3D LASER matrices (if LEDs replaced by LASERs), etc. There is no limit to how much extensions that can be added to this concept. All it takes is creativity, a bit of resources, an Arduino, and coding.
