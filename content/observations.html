	To Turn on LEDs for our setup, specific pins from 2-5 had to be given a LOW voltage and pins 6-9 had to have a HIGH voltage for the LEDs to turn on. Giving the pins the opposite voltage required would leave the corresponding LED off. The chart above maps out our findings of how to turn on each individual LED.
