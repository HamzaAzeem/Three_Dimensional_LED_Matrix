ThreeDimensionalLEDMatrix
=========================
Credit to nodethirtythree for getting us started with web layout

Uses an Arduino Uno R3 board programmed in Arduino Programming Language (based on Wiring, similar to Java) to execute functions to turn LEDs HIGH or LOW in accordance to user-sensor interactivity. User may interact using any of the following receivers/sensors: Bluetooth (Using an Android only app called Amarino to send specific coordinates to microcontroller to turn HIGH or LOW), Light Dependent Resistor (Measures light exposure levels and executes designated blocks of code based on exposure range), Ultrasonic sensor (Measures physical proximity of user from sensor and lights layers depending on how far or close user is). Default static and dynamic patterns are also coded onto Arduino.
